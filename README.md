# WhisperWave-AI-Driven-Air-Noise-Cancellation-System
I built a complete audio-cleaning pipeline using:  • OpenAI Whisper for speech reconstruction • Adaptive DSP filters for air-noise suppression • PyTorch + Librosa for modeling, profiling, and feature extraction • Dynamic environmental tuning to respond to changing noise patterns
